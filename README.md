# Tableau-Chord-Chart
Chord chart for various instruments in Tableau

## Motivation
I was originally looking at mapping floorplans in Tableau, but came up with this idea as it uses the same principals.

## Skills Showcased
* Connecting to data
* Joining data in Tableau
* Custom mappings in Tableau
* Adding marks and text to worksheets
* Using parameters/views

## Future Improvements
* Adding more variations of notes
* Adding additional instruments
  * Guitar, Ukelele, etc.
* Creating additional dashboard views to see multiple instruments simultaneously
* Creating highlight actions that highlight keys as you hover over them
* including sound so that you can hear the notes on the piano
  * Some sort of javascript hacking is involved, need to do more research
* Using lessons learned here to create an R package to plot Piano or other instruments
  * Utilize ggplot2 and gganimate to plot and animate playing
  * Convert .midi files into gganimate plots (.gif output?)
